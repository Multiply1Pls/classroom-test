With the story started when the police found dead bodies that ended life with a scary tactic. All evidence of the investigation points to "John Kramer" or "jigsaw" that has been dead for many years. This clue leads to the answer and chase whoever comes to take over this cruelty. Prior to its victims, its warlike torture
                This jigsaw puzzle also uses a kind of cruelty-type victim that the viewer must tense and nail jig like.
                Imprisoned in a room full of sawn blades. Then each victim must find a way to survive within 1 minute at the same time. The victim's chains were trying to get them to the saw blade, three syringes that hid the poison, the dead man's well, the sharp knife down the chute, the legendary device in the scene. The head has also appeared in this section. The key is to see the victims gather together. And struggling to find the way to salvation as if. This is a reality game with live betting
