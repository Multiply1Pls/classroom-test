             Well you only need the light when it's burning low
        Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
        Only know you love her when you let her go
        Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
        Only hate the road when you're missing home
        Only know you love her when you let her go
        And you let her go
        Staring at the bottom of your glass
        Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
        But dreams come slow and they go so fast
        You see her when you close your eyes
        Maybe one day you'll understand why
        Everything you touch surely dies
        'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
        Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
        Only know you love her when you let her go
        Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
        Only hate the road when you're missing home
        Only know you love her when you let her go
        Staring at the ceiling in the dark
        Same old empty feeling in your heart
        Love comes slow and it goes so fast
        Well you see her when you fall asleep
        But never to touch and never to keep
        'Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep
        'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
        Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
        Only know you love her when you let her go
        Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
        Only hate the road when you're missing home
        Only know you love her when you let her go
        And you let her go
        Oh oh oh no
        And you let her go
        Oh oh oh no
        And you let her go
        Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
        Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
        Only know you love her when you let her go
        Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
        Only hate the road when you're missing home
        Only know you love her when you let her go
        'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
        Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
        Only know you love her when you let her go
        Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
        Only hate the road when you're missing home
        Only know you love her when you let her go
        And you let her go</p></font></h2>
